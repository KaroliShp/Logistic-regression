# Logistic regression: classifying university admission data

This repository stores my IB Maths HL Internal Assesement work on logistic regression. The university admission data is taken from Coursera's Machine Learning course, so is the main background theory. However, the approach to the classification problem in this project is more thoroughly explained, formulas were derived by me and the final solution is different from the one presented in the course (the course is only concerned with the linear solutions)

The code was written in Java from scratch, meaning that I didn't use any external libraries for the logistic regression itself. Even thogh the original code was accidentally deleted and is not included in the project files, snipets of the code are still present in the PDF and should still give a clear image of how the code looked like.

All of the other necessary info is included in the PDF itself.

Mind you, the fellow IB students, that this work is not a "typical" example of IB Mathematics internal assesement, as it's way outside of the syllabus. I do not recommend choosing a similar topic, as what I learned is that you could still score maximum points even if you chose a very simple problem that is in the range of the syllabus.
