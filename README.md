# Logistic regression: classifying university admission data

This repository stores my IB Maths HL Internal Assesement work on logistic regression. The university admission data is taken from Coursera's Machine Learning course. However, this approach to the classification problem is more thoroughly explained and the final solution is different from the one presented in the course. 

All derivations of formulas (from existing ones) were done by me. The code was written in Java without using any of the external libraries. Unfortunately, the code was accidentally deleted; nevertheless, snipets of the code are still present in the PDF and should still give a clear image of how the code looked like.

All of the other necessary info is included in the PDF itself.

Mind you, the fellow IB students, that this work is not a "typical" example of IB Mathematics internal assesement, even at HL, as it's way outside of the syllabus. I do not recommend choosing a similar topic, as you could still score maximum points even if you chose a very simple problem that is in the range of the syllabus.
