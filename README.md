# Logistic-regression

This repository stores my IB Maths HL Internal Assesement work on logistic regression. The university admission data is taken from Coursera's Machine Learning course. However, this approach to the classification problem is more thoroughly explained and the final solution is different from the one presented in the course. 

Mind you, the fellow IB students, that this work is not a "typical" example of IB Mathematics internal assesement, even at HL, as it's way outside of the syllabus.
